This project builds on this foundation coupling conservation (of Jungle) and livelihood (Jeevika). 12 village Gramsabhas are participating in this project with the goal of restoring what is weak, growing what is most wanted, and controlling harvest to sustain it. This project covers over 1,400 hectares of community forests.

The purpose is to document wild edibles and transfer the knowledge to the next generation. The festivals are not for marketing of rare wild edibles. It is a village festival to protect and sustain this super-organic free food and give it its due prestige and protection. 68 villages have conducted such festivals so far. Over 76 wild edible plants are documented.

Vayam has helped many villages across four tribal blocks to build strong community institutions; i.e. Gram-Sabha. These Gram-Sabhas are legally recognized local governing bodies with direct participation of citizens. The empowered Gram Sabhas have brought openness in government schemes, transparency in funds, and have framed rules for judicious extraction from forest and water sources.

The law requires that a majority of voters in a small .hamlet or Pada sit together and pass a resolution for notifying a separate Gramsabha. Vayam volunteers fan out to far-off villages, to alert and motivate people to become self-reliant through their own Gram Sabhas. Many villages have responded positively and received separate Gram-Sabha status as well as funds to run it efficiently.
